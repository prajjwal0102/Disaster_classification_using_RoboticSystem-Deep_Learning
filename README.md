# Disaster_classification_using_RoboticSystem-Deep_Learning
An AI-driven disaster management project that combines CNN-based scene classification, YOLOv8 object detection, and a Tkinter-based GUI dashboard.
It integrates with an ESP32-CAM mounted on a remotely controlled robot, providing operators with real-time situational awareness and better decision-making during disaster response.
